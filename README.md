Name: Shalom Immanuel.P Register No.: 212223050047

Aim:
To explore and understand various prompting techniques used for generating and manipulating videos through AI video generation models.

Apparatus / Software Required:
Computer with internet connectivity
AI Video Generation Platforms such as:
Runway Gen-2
Synthesia
Pictory
DeepBrain AI
Text prompts for generating videos


Algorithm:
Identify and study different AI tools capable of generating videos from text prompts.
Create simple prompts to produce basic video outputs.
Refine prompts by adding detailed elements such as environment, lighting, actions, and expressions.
Include timing, transitions, and motion elements in prompts to enhance video dynamics.
Experiment with different video styles such as animation, cinematic, artistic, and live-action.
Evaluate the generated video and modify the prompt for better output.
Generate multiple video versions by slightly modifying the prompts.
Compare all outputs to understand how prompt variations influence the resulting videos.

Procedure:
Familiarization with AI Video Generation Tools: Explore the features and limitations of tools like:
Runway Gen-2
Synthesia
Pictory
DeepBrain Understand how each model responds to different prompting styles.
Creating Simple Prompts: Begin with basic prompts to generate short videos. Example: “A person walking in a park.”
Using Detailed Prompts: Add more specific details to improve clarity and richness. Example: “A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky and a dog running beside them.”
Adding Time & Motion Elements: Incorporate transitions, timing, and camera movements. Example: “A time-lapse of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out to reveal waves and changing sky colors.”
Testing Different Video Styles: Generate videos in various styles. Example: “An animated scene of a futuristic city at night with neon lights and flying cars.”
Iterating and Adjusting Prompts: Evaluate the generated video and refine prompts for improved results. Example: “A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night with reflections on the wet street.”
Generating Multiple Versions: Create multiple outputs from slightly varied prompts to analyze differences.
Saving & Comparing Outputs: Compare all generated videos to observe how prompt structure affects visual quality, sequence flow, and motion consistency.







Result:
The experiment was successfully performed. Various prompting techniques were explored, and their effects on AI-generated video outputs were clearly observed. The study demonstrated that prompt detail, structure, and style significantly influence the quality, motion, and visual characteristics of AI-generated videos.
